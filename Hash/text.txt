the adventure of the six napoleons
it was no very unusual thing for mr lestrade of scotland
yard to look in upon us of an evening and his visits were wel-
come to sherlock holmes for they enabled him to keep in touch
with all that was going on at the police headquarters in return
for the news which lestrde would bring holmes was always
ready to listen with attention to the details of any case upon
which the detective was engaged and was able occasionally
without any active interference to give some hint or suggestion
drawn from his own vast knowledge and experience
on this particular evening lestrade had spoken of the weather
and the newspapers then he had fallen silent puffing thoughtfully
at his cigar holmes looked keenly at him
anything remarkable on hand? he asked
oh no mr holmes -- nothing very particular
then tell me about it
lestrade laughed
well mr holmes there is no use denying that there is
something on my mind and yet it is such an absurd business
that i hesitated to bother you about it on the other hand
although it is trivial it is undoubtedly queer and i know that
you have a taste for all that is out of the common but in my
opinion it comes more in dr watson's line than ours
disease? said i
madness anyhow and a queer madness too you wouldn't
think there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a
hatred of napoleon the first that he would break any image of
him that he could see
holmes sank back in his chair
that's no business of mine said he
exactly that's what i said but then when the man com-
mits burglary in order to break images which are not his own
that brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman
holmes sat up again
burglary! this is more interesting let me hear the details
lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his mem-
ory from its pages
the first case reported was four days ago said he it was
at the shop of morse hudson who has a place for the sale of
pictures and statues in the kennington road the assistant had
left the front shop for an instant when he heard a crash and
hurrying in he found a plaster bust of napoleon which stood
with several other works of art upon the counter lying shivered
into fragments he rushed out into the road but although sev-
eral passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of
the shop he could neither see anyone nor could he find any
means of identifying the rascal it seemed to be one of those
senseless acts of hooliganism which occur from time to time
and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such the
plaster cast was not worth more than a few shillings and the
whole affair appeared to be too childish for any particular
investigation
the second case however was more serious and also more
singular it occurred only last night
in kennington road and within a few hundred yards of
morse hudson's shop there lives a well-known medical practi-
tioner named dr barnicot who has one of the largest practices
upon the south side of the thames his residence and principal
consulting-room is at kennington road but he has a branch
surgery and dispensary at lower brixton road two miles away
this dr barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of napoleon and his
house is full of books pictures and relics of the french em-
peror some little time ago he purchased from morse hudson
two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of napoleon by
the french sculptor devine one of these he placed in his hall in
the house at kennington road and the other on the mantelpiece
of the surgery at lower brixton well when dr barnicot came
down this morning he was astonished to find that his house had
been burgled during the night but that nothing had been taken
save the plaster head from the hall it had been carried out and
had been dashed savagely against the garden wall under which
its splintered fragments were discovered
holmes rubbed his hands
this is certainly very novel said he
i thought it would please you but i have not got to the end
yet dr barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o'clock and
you can imagine his amazement when on arriving there he
found that the window had been opened in the night and that the
broken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room
it had been smashed to atoms where it stood in neither case
were there any signs which could give us a clue as to the
criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief now mr holmes
you have got the facts
they are singular not to say grotesque said holmes
may i ask whether the two busts smashed in dr barnicot's
rooms were the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed
in morse hudson's shop?
they were taken from the same mould
such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who
breaks them is influenced by any general hatred of napoleon
considering how many hundreds of statues of the great emperor
must exist in london it is too much to suppose such a coinci-
dence as that a promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin
upon three specimens of the same bust
well i thought as you do said lestrade on the other
hand this morse hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of
london and these three were the only ones which had been in
his shop for years so although as you say there are many
hundreds of statues in london it is very probable that these
three were the only ones in that district therefore a local
fanatic would begin with them what do you think dr watson?
there are no limits to the possibilities of monomania i
answered there is the condition which the modern french
psychologists have called the 'idee fixe' which may be trifling in
character and accompanied by complete sanity in every other
way a man who had read deeply about napoleon or who had
possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great
war might conceivably form such an idee fixe and under its
influence be capable of any fantastic outrage
that won't do my dear watson said holmes shaking his
head for no amount of idee fixe would enable your interesting
monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated
well how do you explain it?
i don't attempt to do so i would only observe that there is a
certain method in the gentleman's eccentric proceedings for
example in dr barnicot's hall where a sound might arouse the
family the bust was taken outside before being broken whereas
in the surgery where there was less danger of an alarm it was
smashed where it stood the affair seems absurdly trifling and
yet i dare call nothing trivial when i reflect that some of my most
classic cases have had the least promising commencement you
will remember watson how the dreadful business of the abernetty
family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the
parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day i can't afford
therefore to smile at your three broken busts lestrade and i
shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any
fresh development of so singular a chain of events
the development for which my friend had asked came in a
quicker and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have
imagined i was still dressing in my bedroom next morning
when there was a tap at the door and holmes entered a
telegram in his hand he read it aloud:
come instantly 131 pitt street kensington
lestrade
what is it then? i asked
don't know -- may be anything but i suspect it is the sequel
of the story of the statues in that case our friend the image-
breaker has begun operations in another quarter of london
there's coffee on the table watson and i have a cab at the
door
in half an hour we had reached pitt street a quiet little
backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of london life
no 131 was one of a row all flat-chested respectable and
most unromantic dwellings as we drove up we found the rail-
ings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd holmes
whistled
by george! it's attempted murder at the least nothing less
will hold the london message-boy there's a deed of violence
indicated in that fellow's round shoulders and outstretched
neck what's this watson? the top steps swilled down and
the other ones dry footsteps enough anyhow! well well
there's lestrade at the front window and we shall soon know
all about it
the official received us with a very grave face and showed us
into a sitting-room where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated el-
derly man clad in a flannel dressing-gown was pacing up and
down he was introduced to us as the owner of the house -- mr
horace harker of the central press syndicate
it's the napoleon bust business again said lestrade you
seemed interested last night mr holmes so i thought perhaps
you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a
very much graver turn
what has it turned to then?
to murder mr harker will you tell these gentlemen ex-
actly what has occurred?
the man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most mel-
ancholy face
it's an extraordinary thing said he that all my life i have
been collecting other people's news and now that a real piece of
news has come my own way i am so confused and bothered that
i can't put two words together if i had come in here as a
journalist i should have interviewed myself and had two col-
umns in every evening paper as it is i am giving away valu-
able copy by telling my story over and over to a string of
different people and i can make no use of it myself however
i've heard your name mr sherlock holmes and if you'll only
explain this queer business i shall be paid for my trouble in
telling you the story
holmes sat down and listened
it all seems to centre round that bust of napoleon which i
bought for this very room about four months ago i picked it up
cheap from harding brothers two doors from the high street
station a great deal of my journalistic work is done at night
and i often write until the early morning so it was to-day i was
sitting in my den which is at the back of the top of the house
about three o'clock when i was convinced that l heard some
sounds downstairs i listened but they were not repeated and i
concluded that they came from outside then suddenly about
five minutes later there came a most horrible yell -- the most
dreadful sound mr holmes that ever i heard it will ring in my
ears as long as i live i sat frozen with horror for a minute or
two then i seized the poker and went downstairs when i
entered this room i found the window wide open and i at once
observed that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece why any
burglar should take such a thing passes my understanding for it
was only a plaster cast and of no real value whatever
you can see for yourself that anyone going out through that
open window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long
stride this was clearly what the burglar had done so i went
round and opened the door stepping out into the dark i nearly
fell over a dead man who was lying there i ran back for a light
and there was the poor fellow a great gash in his throat and the
whole place swimming in blood he lay on his back his knees
drawn up and his mouth horribly open i shall see him in my
dreams i had just time to blow on my police-whistle and then i
must have fainted for i knew nothing more until i found the
policeman standing over me in the hall
well who was the murdered man? asked holmes
there's nothing to show who he was said lestrade you
shall see the body at the mortuary but we have made nothing of
it up to now he is a tall man sunburned very powerful not
more than thirty he is poorly dressed and yet does not appear
to be a labourer a horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool
of blood beside him whether it was the weapon which did the
deed or whether it belonged to the dead man i do not know
there was no name on his clothing and nothing in his pockets
save an apple some string a shilling map of london and a
photograph here it is
it was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera it
represented an alert sharp-featured simian man with thick eye-
brows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the
face like the muzzle of a baboon
and what became of the bust? asked holmes after a
careful study of this picture
we had news of it just before you came it has been found in
the front garden of an empty house in campden house road it
was broken into fragments i am going round now to see it will
you come?
certainly i must just take one look round he examined
the carpet and the window the fellow had either very long
legs or was a most active man said he with an area beneath
it was no mean feat to reach that window-ledge and open that
window getting back was comparatively simple are you com-
ing with us to see the remains of your bust mr harker?
the disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a writing-table
i must try and make something of it said he though i
have no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out
already with full details it's like my luck! you remember when
the stand fell at doncaster? well i was the only journalist in the
stand and my journal the only one that had no account of it for
i was too shaken to write it and now i'll be too late with a
murder done on my own doorstep
as we left the room we heard his pen travelling shrilly over
the foolscap
the spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was
only a few hundred yards away for the first time our eyes rested
upon this presentment of the great emperor which seemed to
raise such frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the
unknown it lay scattered in splintered shards upon the grass
holmes picked up several of them and examined them carefully
i was convinced from his intent face and his purposeful manner
that at last he was upon a clue
well? asked lestrade
holmes shrugged his shoulders
we have a long way to go yet said he and yet -- and
yet -- well we have some suggestive facts to act upon the
possession of this trifling bust was worth more in the eyes of
this strange criminal than a human life that is one point then
there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house or
immediately outside the house if to break it was his sole object
he was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow he
hardly knew what he was doing
well that's likely enough but i wish to call your attention
very particularly to the position of this house in the garden of
which the bust was destroyed
lestrade looked about him
it was an empty house and so he knew that he would not be
disturbed in the garden
yes but there is another empty house farther up the street
which he must have passed before he came to this one why did
he not break it there since it is evident that every yard that he
carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?
i give it up said lestrade
holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads
he could see what he was doing here and he could not
there that was his reason
by jove! that's true said the detective now that i come
to think of it dr barnicot's bust was broken not far from his red
lamp well mr holmes what are we to do with that fact?
to remember it -- to docket it we may come on something
later which will bear upon it what steps do you propose to take
now lestrade?
the most practical way of getting at it in my opinion is to
identify the dead man there should be no difficulty about that
when we have found who he is and who his associates are we
should have a good start in learning what he was doing in pitt
street last night and who it was who met him and killed him on
the doorstep of mr horace harker don't you think so?
no doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which i should
approach the case
what would you do then?
oh you must not let me influence you in any way i suggest
that you go on your line and i on mine we can compare notes
afterwards and each will supplement the other
very good said lestrade
if you are going back to pitt street you might see mr
horace harker tell him for me that i have quite made up my
mind and that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic
with napoleonic delusions was in his house last night it will be
useful for his article
lestrade stared
you don't seriously believe that?
holmes smiled
don't i? well perhaps i don't but i am sure that it will
interest mr horace harker and the subscribers of the central
press syndicate now watson i think that we shall find that we
have a long and rather complex day's work before us i should
be glad lestrade if you could make it convenient to meet us at
baker street at six o'clock this evening until then i should like
to keep this photograph found in the dead man's pocket it is
possible that i may have to ask your company and assistance
upon a small expedition which will have to be undertaken to-
night if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct until
then good-bye and good luck!
sherlock holmes and i walked together to the high street
where we stopped at the shop of harding brothers whence the
bust had been purchased a young assistant informed us that mr
harding would be absent until afternoon and that he was himself
a newcomer who could give us no information holmes's face
showed his disappointment and annoyance
well well we can't expect to have it all our own way
watson he said at last we must come back in the after-
noon if mr harding will not be here until then i am as you
have no doubt surmised endeavouring to trace these busts to
their source in order to find if there is not something peculiar
which may account for their remarkable fate let us make for
mr morse hudson of the kennington road and see if he can
throw any light upon the problem
a drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer's establish-
ment he was a small stout man with a red face and a peppery
manner
yes sir on my very counter sir said he what we pay
rates and taxes for i don't know when any ruffian can come in
and break one's goods yes sir it was i who sold dr barnicot
his two statues disgraceful sir! a nihilist plot -- that's what i
make it no one but an anarchist would go about breaking
statues red republicans -- that's what i call 'em who did i get
the statues from? i don't see what that has to do with it welll if
you really want to know i got them from gelder & co in
church street stepney they are a well-known house in the
trade and have been this twenty years how many had l?
three -- two and one are three -- two of dr barnicot's and one
smashed in broad daylight on my own counter do i know that
photograph? no i don't yes i do though why it's beppo
he was a kind of italian piece-work man who made himself
useful in the shop he could carve a bit and gild and frame and
do odd jobs the fellow left me last week and i've heard
nothing of him since no i don't know where he came from nor
where he went to i had nothing against him while he was here
he was gone two days before the bust was smashed
well that's all we could reasonably expect from morse
hudson said holmes as we emerged from the shop we
have this beppo as a common factor both in kennington and in
kensington so that is worth a ten-mile drive now watson let
us make for gelder & co of stepney the source and origin of
the busts i shall be surprised if we don't get some help down
there
in rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashion-
able london hotel london theatrical london literary london
commercial london and finally maritime london till we came
to a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls where the
tenement houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of europe
here in a broad thoroughfare once the abode of wealthy city
merchants we found the sculpture works for which we searched
outside was a considerable yard full of monumental masonry
inside was a large room in which fifty workers were carving or
moulding the manager a big blond german received us civilly
and gave a clear answer to all holmes's questions a reference
to his books showed that hundreds of casts had been taken from
a marble copy of devine's head of napoleon but that the three
which had been sent to morse hudson a year or so before had
been half of a batch of six the other three being sent to harding
brothers of kensington there was no reason why those six
should be different from any of the other casts he could suggest
no possible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them -- in
fact he laughed at the idea their wholesale price was six
shillings but the retailer would get twelve or more the cast
was taken in two moulds from each side of the face and then
these two profiles of plaster of paris were joined together to
make the complete bust the work was usually done by italians
in the room we were in when finished the busts were put on a
table in the passage to dry and afterwards stored that was all
he could tell us
but the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect
upon the manager his face flushed with anger and his brows
knotted over his blue teutonic eyes
ah the rascal! he cried yes indeed i know him very
well this has always been a respectable establishment and the
only time that we have ever had the police in it was over this
very fellow it was more than a year ago now he knifed another
italian in the street and then he came to the works with the
police on his heels and he was taken here beppo was his
name -- his second name i never knew serve me right for engag-
ing a man with such a face but he was a good workman -- one
of the best
what did he get?
the man lived and he got off with a year i have no doubt he
is out now but he has not dared to show his nose here we have
a cousin of his here and i daresay he could tell you where he
is
no no cried holmes not a word to the cousin -- not a
word i beg of you the matter is very important and the farther
i go with it the more important it seems to grow when you
referred in your ledger to the sale of those casts i observed that
the date was june 3rd of last year could you give me the date
when beppo was arrested?
i could tell you roughly by the pay-list the manager an-
swered yes he continued after some turning over of pages
he was paid last on may 20th
thank you said holmes i don't think that i need intrude
upon your time and patience any more with a last word of
caution that he should say nothing as to our researches we
turned our faces westward once more
the afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch
a hasty luncheon at a restaurant a news-bill at the entrance
announced kensington outrage murder by a madman and
the contents of the paper showed that mr horace harker had got
his account into print after all two columns were occupied with
a highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident
holmes propped it against the cruet-stand and read it while he
ate once or twice he chuckled
this is all right watson said he listen to this:
it is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference
of opinion upon this case since mr lestrade one of the
most experienced members of the official force and mr
sherlock holmes the well-known consulting expert have
each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of
incidents which have ended in so tragic a fashion arise
from lunacy rather than from deliberate crime no explana-
tion save mental aberration can cover the facts
the press watson is a most valuable institution if you only
know how to use it and now if you have quite finished we
will hark back to kensington and see what the manager of
harding brothers has to say on the matter
the founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk crisp
little person very dapper and quick with a clear head and a
ready tongue
yes sir i have already read the account in the evening
papers mr horace harker is a customer of ours we supplied
him with the bust some months ago we ordered three busts of
that sort from gelder & co of stepney they are all sold now
to whom? oh i daresay by consulting our sales book we could
very easily tell you yes we have the entries here one to mr
harker you see and one to mr josiah brown of laburnum
lodge laburnum vale chiswick and one to mr sandeford of
lower grove road reading no i have never seen this face
which you show me in the photograph you would hardly forget
it would you sir for i've seldom seen an uglier have we any
italians on the staff? yes sir we have several among our
workpeople and cleaners i daresay they might get a peep at that
sales book if they wanted to there is no particular reason for
keeping a watch upon that book well well it's a very strange
business and i hope that you will let me know if anything comes
of your inquiries
holmes had taken several notes during mr harding's evi-
dence and i could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the
turn which affairs were taking he made no remark however
save that unless we hurried we should be late for our appoint-
ment with lestrade sure enough when we reached baker street
the detective was already there and we found him pacing up and
down in a fever of impatience his look of importance showed
that his day's work had not been in vain
well? he asked what luck mr holmes?
we have had a very busy day and not entirely a wasted
one my friend explained we have seen both the retailers and
also the wholesale manufacturers i can trace each of the busts
now from the beginning
the busts! cried lestrade well well you have your own
methods mr sherlock holmes and it is not for me to say a
word against them but i think i have done a better day's work
than you i have identified the dead man
you don't say so?
and found a cause for the crime
splendid!
we have an inspector who makes a specialty of saffron hill
and the italian quarter well this dead man had some catholic
emblem round his neck and that along with his colour made
me think he was from the south inspector hill knew him the
moment he caught sight of him his name is pietro venucci
from naples and he is one of the greatest cut-throats in lon-
don he is connected with the mafia which as you know is a
secret political society enforcing its decrees by murder now
you see how the affair begins to clear up the other fellow is
probably an italian also and a member of the mafia he has
broken the rules in some fashion pietro is set upon his track
probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man him-
self so that he may not knife the wrong person he dogs the
fellow he sees him enter a house he waits outside for him and
in the scuffle he receives his own death-wound how is that mr
sherlock holmes?
holmes clapped his hands approvingly
excellent lestrade excellent! he cried but i didn't quite
follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts
the busts! you never can get those busts out of your head
after all that is nothing; petty larceny six months at the most it
is the murder that we are really investigating and i tell you that i
am gathering all the threads into my hands
and the next stage?
is a very simple one i shall go down with hill to the italian
quarter find the man whose photograph we have got and arrest
him on the charge of murder will you come with us?
i think not i fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way i
can't say for certain because it all depends -- well it all depends
upon a factor which is completely outside our control but i have
great hopes -- in fact the betting is exactly two to one -- that if
you will come with us to-night i shall be able to help you to lay
him by the heels
in the italian quarter?
no i fancy chiswick is an address which is more likely to
find him if you will come with me to chiswick to-night
lestrade i'll promise to go to the italian quarter with you
to-morrow and no harm will be done by the delay and now i
think that a few hours' sleep would do us all good for i do not
propose to leave before eleven o'clock and it is unlikely that we
shall be back before morning you'll dine with us lestrade and
then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start in
the meantime watson i should be glad if you would ring for an
express messenger for i have a letter to send and it is imponant
that it should go at once
holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the
old daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed
when at last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes but
he said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches
for my own part i had followed step by step the methods by
which he had traced the various windings of this complex case
and though i could not yet perceive the goal which we would
reach i understood clearly that holmes expected this grotesque
criminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts one
of which i remembered was at chiswick no doubt the object
of our journey was to catch him in the very act and i could not
but admire the cunning with which my friend had inserted a
wrong clue in the evening paper so as to give the fellow the idea
that he could continue his scheme with impunity i was not
surprised when holmes suggested that i should take my revolver
with me he had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop
which was his favourite weapon
a four-wheeler was at the door at eleven and in it we drove
to a spot at the other side of hammersmith bridge here the
cabman was directed to wait a short walk brought us to a
secluded road fringed with pleasant houses each standing in its
own grounds in the light of a street lamp we read laburnum
villa upon the gate-post of one of them the occupants had
evidently retired to rest for all was dark save for a fanlight over
the hall door which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden
path the wooden fence which separated the grounds from the
road threw a dense black shadow upon the inner side and here it
was that we crouched
i fear that you'll have a long wait holmes whispered
we may thank our stars that it is not raining i don't think we
can even venture to smoke to pass the time however it's a two
to one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble
it proved however that our vigil was not to be so long as
holmes had led us to fear and it ended in a very sudden and
singular fashion in an instant without the least sound to warn us
of his coming the garden gate swung open and a lithe dark
figure as swift and active as an ape rushed up the garden path
we saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and
disappear against the black shadow of the house there was a
long pause during which we held our breath and then a very
gentle creaking sound came to our ears the window was being
opened the noise ceased and again there was a long silence
the fellow was making his way into the house we saw the
sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room what he sought
was evidently not there for again we saw the flash through
another blind and then through another
let us get to the open window we will nab him as he
climbs out lestrade whispered
but before we could move the man had emerged again as he
came out into the glimmering patch of light we saw that he
carrled something white under his arm he looked stealthily all
round him the silence of the deserted street reassured him
turning his back upon us he laid down his burden and the next
instant there was the sound of a sharp tap followed by a clatter
and rattle the man was so intent upon what he was doing that
he never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot with
the bound of a tiger holmes was on his back and an instant later
lestrade and i had him by either wrist and the handcuffs had
been fastened as we turned him over i saw a hideous sallow
face with writhing furious features glaring up at us and i
knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had
secured
but it was not our prisoner to whom holmes was giving his
attention squatted on the doorstep he was engaged in most
carefully examining that which the man had brought from the
house it was a bust of napoleon iike the one which we had
seen that morning and it had been broken into similar frag-
ments carefully holmes held each separate shard to the light
but in no way did it differ from any other shattered piece of
plaster he had just completed his examination when the hall
lights flew up the door opened and the owner of the house a
jovial rotund figure in shirt and trousers presented himseli
mr josiah brown i suppose? said holmes
yes sir and you no doubt are mr sherlock holmes? i had
the note which you sent by the express messenger and i did
exactly what you told me we locked every door on the inside
and awaited developments well i'm very glad to see that you
have got the rascal i hope gentlemen that you will come in and
have some refreshment
however lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe
quarters so within a few minutes our cab had bcen summoned
and we were all tour upon our way to london not a word
would our captive say but he glared at us from thc shadow of
his matted hair and once when my hand seemed within his
reach he snapped at it like a hungry wolf we stayed long
enough at the police-station to learn that a search of his clothing
revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath knife the
handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood
that's all right said lestrade as we parted hill knows
all these gentry and he will give a name to him you'll find that
my theory of the mafia will work out all right but i'm sure i am
exceedingly obliged to you mr holmes for the workmanlike
way in which you laid hands upon him i don't quite understand
it all yet
i fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations said
holmes besides there are one or two details which are not
finished off and it is one of those cases which are worth
working out to the very end if you will come round once more
to my rooms at six o'clock to-morrow i think i shall be able to
show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning
of this business which presents some features which make it
absolutely original in the history of crime if ever i permit you to
chronicle any more of my little problems watson i foresee that
you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular
adventure of the napoleonic busts
when we met again next evening lestrade was furnished with
much information concerning our prisoner his name it ap-
peared was beppo second name unknown he was a well-
known ne'er-do-well among the italian colony he had once
been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest living but he
had taken to evil courses and had twice already been in jail --
once for a petty theft and once as we had already heard for
stabbing a fellow-countryman he could talk english perfectly
well his reasons for destroying the busts were still unknown
and he refused to answer any questions upon the subject but the
police had discovered that these same busts might very well have
been made by his own hands since he was engaged in this class
of work at the establishment of gelder & co to all this infor-
mation much of which we already knew holmes listened with
polite attention but i who knew him so well could clearly see
that his thoughts were elsewhere and i detected a mixture of
mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he
was wont to assume at last he started in his chair and his eyes
brightened there had been a ring at the bell a minute later we
heard steps upon the stairs and an elderly red-faced man with
grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in in his right hand he
carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag which he placed upon the
table
is mr sherlock holmes here?
my friend bowed and smiled mr sandeford of reading i
suppose? said he
yes sir i fear that i am a little late but the trains
were awkward you wrote to me about a bust that is in my
possession
exactly
i have your letter here you said 'i desire to possess a copy
of devine's napoleon and am prepared to pay you ten pounds
for the one which is in your possession' is that right?
certainly
i was very much surprised at your letter for i could not
imagine how you knew that i owned such a thing
of course you must have been surprised but the explanation
is very simple mr harding of harding brothers said that they
had sold you their last copy and he gave me your address
oh that was it was it? did he tell you what i paid for it?
no he did not
well i am an honest man though not a very rich one i only
gave fifteen shillings for the bust and i think you ought to know
that before i take ten pounds from you
i am sure the scruple does you honour mr sandeford but i
have named that price so i intend to stick to it
well it is very handsome of you mr holmes i brought
the bust up with me as you asked me to do here it is! he
opened his bag and at last we saw placed upon our table a
complete specimen of that bust which we had already seen more
than once in fragments
holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound
note upon the table
you will kindly sign that paper mr sandeford in the
presence of these witnesses it is simply to say that you transfer
every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me i am a
methodical man you see and you never know what turn events
might take afterwards thank you mr sandeford; here is your
money and i wish you a very good evening
when our visitor had disappeared sherlock holmes's move-
ments were such as to rivet our attention he began by taking a
clean white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table
then he placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth
finally he picked up his hunting-crop and struck napoleon a
sharp blow on the top of the head the figure broke into frag-
ments and holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains next
instant with a loud shout of triumph he held up one splinter in
which a round dark object was fixed like a plum in a pudding
gentlemen he cried let me introduce you to the famous
black pearl of the borgias
lestrade and i sat silent for a moment and then with a
spontaneous impulse we both broke out clapping as at the
well-wrought crisis of a play a flush of colour sprang to holmes's
pale cheeks and he bowed to us like the master dramatist who
receives the homage of his audience it was at such moments that
for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine and betrayed
his human love for admiration and applause the same singularly
proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from
popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by
spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend
yes gentlemen said he it is the most famous pearl now
existing in the world and it has been my good fortune by a
connected chain of inductive reasoning to trace it from the
prince of colonna's bedroom at the dacre hotel where it was
lost to the interior of this the last of the six busts of napoleon
which were manufactured by gelder & co of stepney you
will remember lestrade the sensation caused by the disappear-
ance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the london
police to recover it i was myself consulted upon the case but i
was unable to throw any light upon it suspicion fell upon the
maid of the princess who was an italian and it was proved that
she had a brother in london but we failed to trace any connec-
tion between them the maid's name was lucretia venucci and
there is no doubt in my mind that this pietro who was murdered
two nights ago was the brother i have been looking up the dates
in the old files of the paper and i find that the disappearance of
the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of beppo for
some crime of violence -- an event which took place in the
factory of gelder & co at the very moment when these busts
were being made now you clearly see the sequence of events
though you see them of course in the inverse order to the way
in which they presented themselves to me beppo had the pearl
in his possession he may have stolen it from pietro he may
have been pietro's confederate he may have been the go-between
of pietro and his sister it is of no consequence to us which is the
correct solution
the main fact is that he had the pearl and at that moment
when it was on his person he was pursued by the police he
made for the factory in which he worked and he knew that he
had only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously
valuable prize which would otherwise be found on him when he
was searched six plaster casts of napoleon were drying in the
passage one of them was still soft in an instant beppo a
skilful workman made a small hole in the wet plaster dropped
in the pearl and with a few touches covered over the aperture
once more it was an admirable hiding-place no one could
possibly find it but beppo was condemned to a year's imprison-
ment and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over
london he could not tell which contained his treasure only by
breaking them could he see even shaking would tell him noth-
ing for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl
would adhere to it -- as in fact it has done beppo did not
despair and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity
and perseverance through a cousin who works with gelder he
found out the retail firms who had bought the busts he managed
to find employment with morse hudson and in that way tracked
down three of them the pearl was not there then with the
help of some italian employe he succeeded in finding out where
the other three busts had gone the first was at harker's there
he was dogged by his confederate who held beppo responsible
for the loss of the pearl and he stabbed him in the scuffle which
followed
if he was his confederate why should he carry his photo-
graph? i asked
as a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him
from any third person that was the obvious reason well after
the murder i calculated that beppo would probably hurry rather
than delay his movements he would fear that the police would
read his secret and so he hastened on before they should get
ahead of him of course i could not say that he had not found
the pearl in harker's bust i had not even concluded for certain
that it was the pearl but it was evident to me that he was looking
for something since he carried the bust past the other houses in
order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it
since harker's bust was one in three the chances were exactly
as i told you -- two to one against the pearl being inside it there
remained two busts and it was obvious that he would go for the
london one first i warned the inmates of the house so as to
avoid a second tragedy and we went down with the happiest
results by that time of course i knew for certain that it was the
borgia pearl that we were after the name of the murdered man
linked the one event with the other there only remained a single
bust -- the reading one -- and the pearl must be there i bought it
in your presence from the owner -- and there it lies
we sat in silence for a moment
well said lestrade i've seen you handle a good many
cases mr holmes but i don't know that i ever knew a more
workmanlike one than that we're not jealous of you at scotland
yard no sir we are very proud of you and if you come down
to-morrow there's not a man from the oldest inspector to the
youngest constable who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the
hand
thank you! said holmes thank you! and as he turned
away it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the
softer human emotions than i had ever seen him a moment later
he was the cold and practical thinker once more put the pearl
in the safe watson said he and get out the papers of the
conk-singleton forgery case good-bye lestrade if any little
problem comes your way i shall be happy if i can to give you
a hint or two as to its solution
