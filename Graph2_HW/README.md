# Finding the shortest path in New York

In this homework, the problem is to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path with a large graph.
The file `data/USA-road-d-NY.gr` contains the topology of the graph in the following image :
![alt txt](data/NY_Metropolitan.png)

It contains 264346 vertices and 733846 edges.

**Note : this is just an image showing the topology, you're not going to see this in c++.**

Description of the struct
------------------------
`struct Node` defines a vertices, with its distance to a certain vertex.

`struct Graph` defines a generic graph, and contains the method `int shortestPath(V source, V destination, map<V, int>& distances)` that
we saw in the lecture. The return value is modified so that it returns the number of iterations needed.

You might need the following methods:

`bool hasEdge(V i, V j)` returns `true` if there's an edge (i, j)

`int edgeWeight(V i, V j)` returns the weight of the edge (i, j) (0 if edge (i, j) doesn't exist)

`set<V> neighbors(V i)` returns the neighbors of vertex `i`.


Exercise 1
------------------------
Test the environment by running, in `main()`,
```
Graph<int> g;
readGraph("data/USA-road-d-NY.gr", g);

int source = 190635, destination = 187333;

g.shortestPath(source, destination); //forward search
g.shortestPath(destination, source); //backward search
```

You should see the following result :
```
reading graph...    
done.

Distance : 46834 in 1826 steps.
Distance : 46834 in 2405 steps.
```

Here, forward search means that we use Dijsktra's algorithm starting from `source`, and stops when `destination` is in `visited`.
Conversely, backward search means that we start from `destination`.

This graph is a non-oriented graph, that's why the distance from `source` to `destination` is the same as from `destination` to `source`.
Basically, if edge (a, b) exists, then so does (b, a), and they have the same weight.

Exercise 2
-----------------------
The original Dijkstra seems good enough, in that it found the distance already fast. However, since `source` and `destination` plays
exactly the same role (important : this is only true in a **non-oriented** graph), we can actually use *two* Dijkstra algorithms, one
starting from `source` and the other starting from `destination`. We call it **bidirectional Dijkstra**.

The original Dijkstra draws concentric circles centered in `source`, and increases the radius gradually, until `destination` is included
in the circle.

In bidirectional Dijkstra, two groups of circles, centerd in `source` and `destination`, increase their sizes using the original Dijkstra,
and the algorithm finishes when the two circles intersect.

The algorithm is illustrated below : 
![alt txt](data/bidijkstra.png)

where the left image describes the original Dijkstra, and the right describes bidirectional Dijkstra.

Fill in `void Graph<V>::shortestPath_bi(V source, V destination)`. Conserve the last line `cout<<"Distance : "<<d<<" in "<<i<<" steps."<<endl;`
in the method to output the result. `d` should be set to the distance between `source` and `destination`, and `i` set to the number of
iterations.

Hint : To make sure that the two circles grow at the same rate, perform Dijkstra alternately on the *forward* queue (starting from `source`
) and on the *backward* queue (from `destination`).
For example,
```
//initialize the queues, distances, visiteds,... for the two groups here

int i=0;
while(!termination condition){
    if(i%2==0){
        //perform Dijsktra for 1 step on the forward queue
    } else {
        //perform Dijsktra for 1 step on the backward queue
    }
    i++;
}
```
To determine the `termination condition`, you must keep track of the last node visited, and if it's in both `visited`s, terminate the algorithm.

Once finished, run, in `main()`,

```
readGraph("data/USA-road-d-NY.gr", g);

int source = 190635, destination = 187333;

g.shortestPath(source, destination); //forward search
g.shortestPath(destination, source); //backward search
g.shortestPath_bi(source, destination); //bidirectional search
```
You should see the following result :
```
reading graph...    
done.

Distance : 46834 in 1826 steps.
Distance : 46834 in 2405 steps.
Distance : 46834 in 1119 steps.
```

Depending on how you count the iterations, the number of steps might be different, but it should be roughly half of that of the original Dijkstra.

Now, change `source` and `destination`, and run again :
```
int source = 190637, destination = 187334;
```

What do you observe?

Exercise 3
------------------
Actually, the above algorithm is not totally correct. Look at the following image :

![alt txt](data/terminaison-bidijkstra.png)

In exercise 2, we've found the x in this image (note that there is only one such x in the intersection of the circles. Why?), and we postulate that the minimal distance from `source` to `destination` is equal to the distance from `source` to `x` plus `x` to `destination`. However, this is not totally true. Actually, we need to examine all pairs (i, j) such that `i` is examined by the *forward* queue and `j` is examined by the *backward* queue. Since they're not yet examined by the other queue, it could be that the path `source->i->j->destination` be shorter than `source->x->destination`.

Fill in `void Graph<V>::shortestPath_bi_correct(V source, V destination)`. You just need to add a couple of lines more in addition to the code in the previous exercise.

Hint : Decide for which pairs (i, j) to run the following code:
```
d = min(d, distancesF[i]+edgeWeight(i,j)+distancesB[j]);
```
where `distancesF` is the distance dictionary of the forward queue, and `distancesB` that of the backward queue.

Once finished, run, in `main()`,

```
readGraph("data/USA-road-d-NY.gr", g);

int source = 190637, destination = 187334;

g.shortestPath(source, destination); //forward search
g.shortestPath(destination, source); //backward search
g.shortestPath_bi(source, destination); //bidirectional search
g.shortestPath_bi_correct(source, destination); //bidirectional search
```
You should see the following result :
```
reading graph...    
done.

Distance : 35478 in 1251 steps.
Distance : 35478 in 1203 steps.
Distance : 35489 in 621 steps.
Distance : 35478 in 621 steps.
```
The last line shows that now the distance is computed correctly, and almost 2 times faster.
